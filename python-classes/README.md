# Python - Classes and Objects

This directory contains solutions to the **Python - Classes and Objects** project.

The tasks focus on understanding and implementing:
- How to define a class in Python
- The difference between public, protected, and private attributes
- The purpose and use of `__init__`, instance attributes, and class attributes
- How to add methods to a class
- How to use properties (`@property`) and setters to control attribute access
- Printing custom objects using instance methods
